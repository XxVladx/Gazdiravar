                Autumn is beautiful. With the vibrant fall colors, smells, refreshing temperatures it creates the
                perfect environment for long walks with our canine companions.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                However, keep these fall safety tips in mind during this season and the next time you and your furry
                friend head outside.
            </p>

                    <h4 class="text-align slide-in">Keep School Supplies Out of Pawsâ€™ Reach!</h4>
                    <p>Fall is back-to-school time and for those of you with young children, this means having
                        school supplies used often. School supplies can be very dangerous if left outside accessible
                        to your pets. If ingested, they can cause blockages or gastrointestinal upset, so keep them
                        out of reach from your pets.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4 class="text-align slide-in">Donâ€™t Share Chocolate Or Treats With Your Pets!</h4>
                    <p>Chocolate, candy and other tasty holiday treats are not for pets. Many can contain artificial
                        sweeteners and other ingredients that are toxic for them. So itâ€™s important to make sure you
                        donâ€™t give them these types of food and you donâ€™t leave them easily accessible, as your pets
                        can find them and eat them.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-align slide-in">Be Cautious With Leaf Piles!</h4>
                    <p>Although leaf piles can be a lot of fun for your dog, avoid letting them jump into piles that
                        have been sitting awhile. They can harbor mold, ticks, and other irritants that can affect
                        your petâ€™s health. Always check your dog for ticks thoroughly after returning from the
                        outdoors. Stones and plant material can also get caught between toes and cause trauma.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-align slide-in">Watch Out for Wildlife!</h4>
                    <p>Wild animals are preparing for their winter hibernation at this time. If you are taking walks
                        in the woods with your dog, keep a close eye out for wildlife and mind your distance to
                        eliminate any injury or disease transmission! If you are living in or visiting an area where
                        snakes may be found, make sure you know what kinds of venomous snakes may be lurking in your
                        environment and where those snakes are most likely to be found to eliminate walking in those
                        areas with your pet.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-align slide-in">Steer Clear of Mushrooms!</h4>
                    <p>While most of the mushrooms that are starting to pop up on forest floors are safe to eat,
                        others are highly toxic to your pet and itâ€™s best not to take the risk. Make sure you
                        prevent your dog from ingesting them by keeping them away from areas where any mushrooms are
                        growing, supervising independent play, keeping your dog close during off-leash walks and
                        hikes.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions to make sure you know whatâ€™s safe and whatâ€™s
                not.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Get out there and enjoy the health and social benefits of walking. Your pet will enjoy it and we are
                sure you will too.
