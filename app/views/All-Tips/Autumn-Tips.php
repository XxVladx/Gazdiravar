                Autumn is beautiful. With the vibrant fall colors, smells, refreshing temperatures it creates the perfect environment for long walks with our canine companions.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                However, keep these fall safety tips in mind during this season and the next time you and your furry friend head outside.

                    <h4>Keep School Supplies Out of Pawsâ€™ Reach!</h4>
                    <p>Fall is back-to-school time and for those of you with young children, this means having school supplies used often. School supplies can be very dangerous if left outside accessible to your pets. If ingested, they can cause blockages or gastrointestinal upset, so keep them out of reach from your pets.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Donâ€™t Share Chocolate Or Treats With Your Pets!</h4>
                    <p>Chocolate, candy and other tasty holiday treats are not for pets. Many can contain artificial sweeteners and other ingredients that are toxic for them. So itâ€™s important to make sure you donâ€™t give them these types of food and you donâ€™t leave them easily accessible, as your pets can find them and eat them.</p>

                    <h4>Be Cautious With Leaf Piles!</h4>
                    <p>Although leaf piles can be a lot of fun for your dog, avoid letting them jump into piles that have been sitting awhile. They can harbor mold, ticks, and other irritants that can affect your petâ€™s health. Always check your dog for ticks thoroughly after returning from the outdoors. Stones and plant material can also get caught between toes and cause trauma.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Watch Out for Wildlife!</h4>
                    <p>Wild animals are preparing for their winter hibernation at this time. If you are taking walks in the woods with your dog, keep a close eye out for wildlife and mind your distance to eliminate any injury or disease transmission! If you are living in or visiting an area where snakes may be found, make sure you know what kinds of venomous snakes may be lurking in your environment and where those snakes are most likely to be found to eliminate walking in those areas with your pet.</p>

                    <h4>Steer Clear of Mushrooms!</h4>
                    <p>While most of the mushrooms that are starting to pop up on forest floors are safe to eat, others are highly toxic to your pet and itâ€™s best not to take the risk. Make sure you prevent your dog from ingesting them by keeping them away from areas where any mushrooms are growing, supervising independent play, keeping your dog close during off-leash walks and hikes.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions to make sure you know whatâ€™s safe and whatâ€™s not.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Get out there and enjoy the health and social benefits of walking. Your pet will enjoy it and we are sure you will too.
