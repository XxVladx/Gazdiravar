                    Halloween or Hallowe‚Äôen, also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows‚Äô Eve, or All Saints‚Äô Eve, is a celebration observed in many countries on October 31st.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    It begins the observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the departed.

                    The word itself literally means ‚Äúhallowed evening,‚Äù and was previously known to early European celebrators as All Hallows‚Äô Eve. All Hallows‚Äô Eve (October 31) and All Saints‚Äô Day (November 1) both paid homage to saints (‚Äúhallows‚Äù = saints). The name was eventually shortened to ‚ÄúHalloween,‚Äù which we know and love to this day.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Halloween falls on October 31st because the ancient Gaelic festival of Samhain, considered the earliest known root of Halloween, occurred on this day. It marked a pivotal time of year when seasons changed, but more importantly, observers also believed the boundary between this world and the next became especially thin at this time, enabling them to connect with the dead.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Hundreds of years ago, people were said to dress up as saints and recite songs or verses door to door, which is the origin of Halloween costumes and trick-or-treating.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    No matter how old you are or how many times you‚Äôve been around the block, the holiday simply never gets old.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Whether you are out there trick-or-treating or perhaps you are lighting a candle for your loved ones, we are with you on this special day.
