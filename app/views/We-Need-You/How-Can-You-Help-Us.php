                    <hr>
                    <p class="mt-4">There are several ways you can help us:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Like our social media posts, comment, and share them to spread the word about what we do,
                            helping the shelters, rescues, and their animals we help. Remember that every share counts.
                            It might be your share that will help find a home for that animal.</li><br>
                        <li>We will post the information if a pet has found a forever home, but if you hear about it
                            first, let us know so we can update our information and spread the good news.</li><br>
                        <li>Check out our older posts as well, and if you see that an animal is still available for
                            adoption, spread the news about it.</li><br>
                        <li>Follow us on our social media platforms:
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gazdiravar/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>,
                            <a href="https://twitter.com/gazdiravar" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gazdiravar/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gazdiravar" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>If you see a post elsewhere where an animal has been in a shelter for a long time, let us
                            know, and we will help to spread the word on our website and social media platforms.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If you know a shelter or animal rescue that needs help with graphics design, marketing, or
                            website design, let us know as we can help with that too. We do this for free because we
                            know how difficult it is already for these organizations managing a rescue financially.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If you know a shelter or animal rescue that is open to allowing animals to find a home
                            abroad, let us know. We would be happy to get in touch with them, and then we would see how
                            this could be accomplished.</li><br>
                        <li>If there is a shelter or animal rescue nearby where you live, ask them what they need help
                            with. Due to the pandemic, many shelters have found themselves in a very difficult
                            situation. They will be happy for all your kind words and support.</li>
