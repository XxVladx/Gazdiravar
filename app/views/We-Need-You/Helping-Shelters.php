                    <p>
                        Most animal shelters and organizations rely completely on the generosity
                        and support of the public. Without the help of volunteers, they would not be able to
                        handle all the animals that need their support. Helping a cat or a dog who might have lost
                        hope in people due to what they have gone through, to feel safe and loved again is priceless
                        and also increases the chance of them being adopted.
                    </p>

                        Search for your favorite animal shelter on Gazdiravar here & check what kind of volunteer work they need. If you cannot find it on Gazdiravar, email us at <a href="mailto:gazdiravar@yahoo.com">gazdiravar@yahoo.com</a> and we will find out and let you know. We will also add that shelter to our website so that others may find that information as well in the future.

                    <p>
                        Donate items you don’t need at home. You might not realize that a lot of things you have at home could be extremely useful at shelters. See a list of items that most shelters accept <a href="#">here</a>.

                    <h3>3. Foster an Animal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Foster an animal from an animal shelter. Fostering an animal means that one more animal is able to get space at a shelter as your home functions as an addition/extension to their space/facility and care. You are saving one life already by doing this even though fostering is temporary as that animal is waiting for someone to adopt him/her while in your care.

                    <h3>5. Donate Money</h3>
                    <p>
                        Donate money. Search for your favorite animal shelter on Gazdiravar here & check how they accept donations. This can differ from organization to organization. However, most shelters will accept checks, money order, money sent to their bank account, or online payment via PayPal or credit card. If both you and your spouse donate, here is a link where you can get some advice on pooling your donations to maximize your benefit income tax time in Canada: <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/make-donations-animal-charities-count-7936">Turbotax</a>. If you cannot find the animal shelter you are looking for on Gazdiravar, email us at <a href="mailto:gazdiravar@yahoo.com">gazdiravar@yahoo.com</a> and we will get the information for you. We will also add that shelter to our website so that others may donate to them as well.

                    <p>
                        When You Donate Money, Make Sure Your Donation Qualifies. Not all donations qualify for a credit at tax time. Due to a number of scams involving fake 'charities', it's best to make sure your donation is actually going to a good cause. If you live in Canada, check out the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA’s) list of qualified charities before donating: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-34900-donations-gifts/which-donations-claim.html">Qualified-Charities</a>. Also, take a look at your donation receipt for validity purposes so that it contains specific information including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A statement that the receipt is for tax purposes.</li>
                        <li>The full name and address of the organization as well as the name and website address for CRA.</li>
                        <li>The date the donation was made as well as the amount.</li>
                        <li>The CRA registration number of the charity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As with other credits, it’s not necessary to send in your receipts with your return in Canada. Keep them on file for at least five years, just in case CRA requests more information.

                    <h3>6. Request Donations or Special Occasions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ask for donations to go to your favorite animal shelter when it’s your birthday, Christmas, wedding day, or during other special occasions when you would expect gifts from relatives and friends. You could check with the shelter in mind in terms of what they need most to make sure that they can definitively use everything that will be donated, let it be money or certain items they need. This will also be a great PR for that organization as you will be spreading the word about what they do by doing this to all of the people you know.
